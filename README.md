## About the System
This tool is designed to inspect and classify manufactured products into one of three categories: "Good," "Flawed," or "Broken."

 It takes images of newly manufactured products as input and outputs a prediction of the product's condition & its respective probability. It is based on deep learning and computer vision.

## Features
- Real-time Decision Making by providing the ability to insert an image and get real-time inference results.
- Highly accurate model in the identification of product conditions.
- The model is trained on over 1000 real product images.
- Augmentation was applied to enhance the dataset with more samples.
- Easy and simple-to-use web interface.
- The model is ready to be integrated into a production line.

## Deployment
The final web application has been deployed on Azure App Services, ensuring scalability and reliability. Azure Blob Containers are used for storing deep learning models and product images for seamless integration with the web application.
